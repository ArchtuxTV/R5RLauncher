# R5RLauncher

Note: I am not affiliated with the develeopment of R5 Reloaded! This is a Unoffical Launcher

This is a simple Launcher/Updater for R5 Reloaded (https://github.com/Mauler125/detours_r5)

If you want to build this yourself you will need to add the Guna.UI2.dll.

Other Note: The updater dose not pull from R5 Reloaded's github. I download the files and re-zip them and then upload them to my own host for download.
