# R5RLauncher

Note: I am not affiliated with the develeopment of the R5 Reloaded! This is a unoffical Launcher

This is a simple Launcher/Updater for R5 Reloaded (https://github.com/Mauler125/detours_r5)

If you want to build this yourself you will need to add the Guna.UI2.dll from the Dependency folder.
